    <h2> Students Organization </h2>
      <p> It was a job where I learned about the dynamics and the process of creating a large event from scratch. I was responsible for co-creating creative concepts of our program and music line-up, contacting the sponsors, guest service, issuing media accreditations and taking care of artists. My role didn’t end with the organization, I also worked during the whole event, caring for the continuity of the event. All this helped me develop my organizational and service skills, my ability to work in a team and the effectiveness of communication.
      The greatest value of this experience was the satisfaction of the event participants. Thanks to the fact that I participated in the preparation and implementation process, I had direct contact with our recipients as well. I could see the effects of my hard work with my own eyes, how the ideas were implemented and how our guests reacted, which gave me a huge satisfaction. </p>

      <h2> Theater internship </h2>
      <p> During the internship I was responsible for developing a concept for the promotion of a theatrical performance. To create it I used a design thinking methodology, which allowed me to understand the essence of this project and create a completely different and unforgettable experience for the viewers. Design thinking is an extremely useful and universal approach that changes the way you look at a project, puts the recipient at the center of all your activities, no matter what you do. It was a perfect example that culture and creativity can go hand in hand with thinking about business and the needs of the recipients. I was very satisfied with the fact that all the ideas and the whole concept that I developed during the internship was realized. Starting with the forms of reaching and communicating with recipients to the visual concept of invitations, gadgets and planning the theater space. As a result, I had a real impact on the creation of promotional communication in every aspect. </p>

      <h2> Polish Film Festival in Gdynia </h2>
      <p> During the two editions of this festival, I was able to practice my skills in many tasks related to the organization of the event. The direct contact with Polish and foreign guests was a valuable value of this experience. I was helping guide them through intricate booking systems, providing information and advising about the program. I took care of the comfort and satisfaction with participation.
    The work required quick reactions, good time management, and the right approach and excellent service. I have often worked under stressful conditions in which I had to be professional and mindful. I realized that I was part of a prestigious event and I had a real influence on its quality and success. What is important to me, it was a combination of work with passion and a perfect opportunity to work with inspiring people, motivated to act like me. </p>

      <h2> Work&Travel United States </h2>
    <p> The most important challenges that influenced my personal and professional development were 2 work & travel trips to the United States. Thanks to them I have developed in the area of customer service and professional comunication as employee of the 5-star resort with the highest standards. I deepened my knowledge of the language and trained my understanding of various accents. Working at banquets, I also got to know from the background what their organization looks like.
    Working and living in a completely foreign country and culture allowed me to get to know myself better and increase self-discipline and be open to constant changes. The international work environment required diligence and flexibility from me to constantly find myself in completely new situations and efficiently solve problems. Thanks to this experience, I learned humility and respect for my work and how important the cooperation of the entire team and ffective communication are.</p>
